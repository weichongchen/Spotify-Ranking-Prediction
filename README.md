Spotify Music Ranking Prediction through Network Science and Machine Learning

– Improved prediction accuracy from 60% to 90% with features and proper network size while having small variance.
– Constructed a ranking prediction system with Random Forest and support vector machine (SVM) based on features.
– Extracted and processed several useful features from Spotify database, and built some features from knowledge of network science, such as degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality for genre and song.
– Identified that genre (chronological genre trend) and song centralities have small influence on ranking prediction.
